# Seed Storage Solutions

[Seedplate](https://store.coinkite.com/store/seedplate)

You can create a "multishard seed", where your seed is split into 3 shards, such that any 2 parts can reconstruct your complete seed. Each shard allows you to store up to 16 words of your seed phrase, and each unit tells you which 16 out of the 24 total words to load up. Shard One houses words 1 to 16, Shard Two houses words 9 to 24 and Shard 3 houses words 1 to 8 and 17 to 24. Once this process is complete, you will have effectively backed up each seed word twice.

# Altcoin Trading

## Portfolio Allocation

This is my portfolio allocation. I hold the majority in Bitcoin. I would only buy other coins if they are likely to outperform Bitcoin.

* Bitcoin (BTC) = 70% to 100%
* Ethereum (ETH) <= 30%
* Enjin (ENJ) <= 10%
* 0x (ZRX) <= 5%
* Secret (SCRT) <= 5%
* Storj (STORJ) <= 5%
* POWR <= 2%
* LINK <= 2%
* DOT <= 2%
* MANA <= 1%
* Band Protocol (BAND)
* Bancor (BNT)
* yearn.finance (YFI)
* Ren (REN)
* Hegic (HEGIC)
* Uniswap (UNI)
* Polkadot (DOT)
* Binance Coin (BNB) - fuel for Binance Smart Chain (BSC)

I occassionally trade a small amount of "questionable" coins, which Bitcoin maxis commonly refer to as "shitcoins". I do not recommend holding these coins for longer than a month or holding any amount that you cannot afford to lose completely. The price is driven by pure speculation rather than a working decentralized product.

* Dogecoin (DOGE)
* Litecoin (LTC)
* Cardano (ADA)
* Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR)
* Nano (NANO)
* Ripple (XRP)

# Project Evaluation

Is product already working?

How strong is the ecosystem (developers, businesses, and users)?

What differentiates it from its competitors?

Does the monetary policy reward long-term holders?

Is the governance decentralised and resistant to attacks?

Are on-chain metrics indicating confidence in the project?
