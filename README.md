# CRYPTO INVESTING GUIDE

This is a quick reference guide for crypto investors.

# The traditional financial system

M2 money supply historically has increased around 7% per year, until 2019 when the growth rate was above 15%. In 2020, the growth rate was at 25%. Assuming the money supply continues to increase by 20% over the next 10 years, your real wealth (purchasing power) would reduce by over 80%, even though the dollar value in your bank account remains the same.

Lyn Alden provides a good explanation of inflation - [November 2020 Newsletter: Defining Inflation](https://www.lynalden.com/november-2020-newsletter/).

The CPI is usually kept below 3% per year because because the way that CPI is reported was changed since the early-1980's. Instead of measuring the cost of maintaining a constant standard of living, we now measure the cost of maintaining a constant level of satisfaction.

[Shadow Government Statistics](http://www.shadowstats.com/) provides statistics using pre-1980 methodology, which shows that the pre-1980 CPI is double than of the official CPI.

[WTF Happened In 1971?](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/)

Tax and money printing was a temporary measure.

CBDCs are not cryptocurrencies.

# The decentralized financial system

[Ash Egan - Crypto Market Map](https://medium.com/@Ashaegan/market-mapping-crypto-f2c138130356), published in 2019 provides a good overview of the crypto ecosystem. It's a bit outdated now since there's been a lot of changes over the past 2 years. However, the key components remain the same.
![](images/crypto-market-map.jpeg)

We have "crypto enablement" which consists of centralized and regulated entities (mostly exchanges) that funnel new users from the traditional fiat system. Eventually, those users discover that there is more to converting fiat to crypto and leaving their crypto on the exchange and hoping to sell at a higher price. They discover that they can bypass intermediaries and perform all financial activities natively on the protocol, including self-custody, earning passive income, and sending and receiving digital assets peer-to-peer.

# Why does Bitcoin exist?

Bitcoin is digital money that preserves its value across space and time. This contrasts with gold and fiat money. Gold is difficult to transport over space and difficult to verify its authenticity. Fiat loses value over time because central banks have a history of losing their independence and debasing their currency.

Lifeboat.

# Common misconceptions about Bitcoin

## Bitcoin uses too much energy

[Bitcoin uses more electricity than Argentina - 9News](https://www.9news.com.au/technology/bitcoin-uses-more-electricity-than-argentina-norway-study-finds/eb51703b-db82-4fd3-ab2a-c79b96523455)

What the FUD articles assume is that there is zero value in securing a monetary network, and therefore any electricity used for the purpose is wasteful. It also ignores that the majority of Bitcoin mining is being powered by renewal energy or excess energy, and is moving towards that direction.

Setee is a company controlled by Norway's 2nd richest man, Kjell Inge Røkke. This is an excerpt from their [shareholder letter](https://www.seetee.io/static/shareholder_letter-6ae7e85717c28831bf1c0eca1d632722.pdf):

> Sec­ond, See­tee will es­tab­lish min­ing op­er­a­tions that trans­fer strand­ed or in­ter­mit­tent elec­tric­i­ty with­out sta­ble de­mand lo­cal­ly—wind, so­lar, hy­dro pow­er— to eco­nom­ic as­sets that can be used any­where. Bit­coin is, in our eyes, a load-bal­anc­ing eco­nom­ic bat­tery, and bat­ter­ies are es­sen­tial to the en­er­gy tran­si­tion re­quired to reach the tar­gets of the Paris Agreement. Our am­bi­tion is to be a valu­able part­ner in new re­new­able projects.

## Bitcoin has no intrinsic value

## The other coins are more affordable

[The next Bitcoin? Investors flock to new cryptocurrency 'ADA' - 9News](https://www.9news.com.au/national/bitcoin-news-investors-hunt-for-next-big-cryptocurrency-as-ada-explodes/5cf444f8-c01f-4059-a9a5-ec673d6a6999)

## Bitcoin could dissappear like MySpace

"Blockchain not Bitcoin".

## Bitcoin will be banned

Bitcoin has flourished in countries where it is banned. For example, in Nigeria where use of crypto is banned, people continue to use it, and crypto adoption in the country is at 32% which is the highest in any country in the world. Bitcoin is a decentralized network. There is no entity to shut down, and any effort to shut it down is likely to bring more attention to crypto and reveal more problems about the Nigeria's dire economic situation.

# Hardware Wallets

Hardware wallets are the preferred cold storage solution. They store your seed and allow you to verify the transaction that you are signing on a separate device.

[Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/)

[Trezor](https://trezor.io/)

[Coldcard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) - This supports Bitcoin only.

Note - The derivation path for each hardware wallet may be different.

# Wallet Software

[Metamask](https://metamask.io/) - Ethereum wallet

[Specter Wallet](https://specter.solutions/) - Bitcoin wallet which can run a full-node

[Electrum](https://electrum.org/) - Bitcoin wallet which connects to the Electrum node.

# Seed Backup Solutions

[Billfodl](https://privacypros.io/)

[Seedplate](https://store.coinkite.com/store/seedplate)

You can create a "multishard seed", where your seed is split into 3 shards, such that any 2 parts can reconstruct your complete seed. Each shard allows you to store up to 16 words of your seed phrase, and each unit tells you which 16 out of the 24 total words to load up. Shard One houses words 1 to 16, Shard Two houses words 9 to 24 and Shard 3 houses words 1 to 8 and 17 to 24. Once this process is complete, you will have effectively backed up each seed word twice.

# Crypto Custody Solutions

[What are cryptocurrency custody solutions - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-are-cryptocurrency-custody-solutions/)

[Coinbase Custody](https://custody.coinbase.com/)

[Independent Reserve High Net Worth](https://www.independentreserve.com/products/high-net-worth)

# Bitcoin Lightning Wallets

The [Lightning Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Network) is a layer on top of Bitcoin that enables faster and smaller P2P transactions. Treat your lightning wallet the same as your cash wallet you take with you on the go. It's expected that most Bitcoin transactions will eventually happen off-chain, and the only transactions on-chain will mainly be large value settlements between insititutions and other high net worth entities.

* [Muun wallet](https://muun.com/) - non-custodial wallet
* [Blue Wallet](https://bluewallet.io/) - non-custodial wallet

# Lending and Staking

Centralized finance (CeFi) platforms allow people to earn interest with Bitcoin directly, however, the funds are held in custodial fashion, unlike DeFi.

[StakingRewards](https://www.stakingrewards.com/) - passive income opportunities with digital assets.

[DeFi Rate](https://defirate.com/) - interest rates from the top crypto lending protocols and crypto banks.

Centralized platforms:
* [BlockFi](https://www.blockfi.com/)
* [Celsius Network](https://celsius.network/)
* [Nexo Finance](https://nexo.io/)
* [Binance Earn](https://www.binance.com/en/earn)
* [Bitfinex Lend and Earn](https://www.bitfinex.com/lending-products-start/)

Decentralized platforms:
* [AAVE](https://aave.com/)
* [Compound](https://compound.finance/)
* [dYdX](https://dydx.exchange/)

On-chain staking:
* [Stacks 2.0](https://stacks.org/) - Stacks (STX) are used as fuel for smart contract execution, transaction processing, and digital asset registrations on the Stacks 2.0 blockchain. It's used as fuel for blockchain transactions and enables holders to earn Bitcoin with Stacking. Stacks enables new use cases like Bitcoin NFTs and stablecoins that settle on Bitcoin.
* [Ethereum 2.0](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/staking/) - You can earn rewards by running a eth2 validator node. You will need to lock up 32 ETH, and you cannot withdraw both your deposit and rewards until Phase 1.5 (which can take 1-2 years or longer). Alternatively, you can deposit into a staking pool, custodian or convert to a staking token such as [Binance ETH 2.0 (BETH)](https://www.binance.com/en/eth2). See [Ethereum 2.0 Staking Guide](https://www.stakingrewards.com/journal/ultimate-ethereum-2-0-staking-guide).

# Altcoin Trading

## Portfolio Allocation

This is my portfolio allocation. I hold the majority in Bitcoin. I would only buy other coins if they are likely to outperform Bitcoin.

* Bitcoin (BTC) = 70% to 100%
* Ethereum (ETH) <= 30%
* Enjin (ENJ) <= 10%
* 0x (ZRX) <= 5%
* Secret (SCRT) <= 5%
* Storj (STORJ) <= 5%
* POWR <= 2%
* LINK <= 2%
* DOT <= 2%
* MANA <= 1%
* Band Protocol (BAND)
* Bancor (BNT)
* yearn.finance (YFI)
* Ren (REN)
* Hegic (HEGIC)
* Uniswap (UNI)
* Polkadot (DOT)
* Binance Coin (BNB) - fuel for Binance Smart Chain (BSC)

I occassionally trade a small amount of "questionable" coins, which Bitcoin maxis commonly refer to as "shitcoins". I do not recommend holding these coins for longer than a month or holding any amount that you cannot afford to lose completely. The price is driven mostly by speculation and marketing rather than any working decentralized product. However, sometimes technological progress follows after speculation, so it's still worth keeping an eye on shitcoins. Also, the growth of shitcoins are a good indicator of new retail investors entering the market.

* Litecoin (LTC)
* Cardano (ADA)
* Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR)
* Nano (NANO)
* Ripple (XRP)

# Project Evaluation

Is the product already working?

How strong is the ecosystem (developers, businesses, and users)?

What is the unique selling proposition (USP), and how is it different from its competitors?

Does the monetary policy reward long-term holders?

Is the governance decentralised and resistant to attacks?

Are on-chain metrics indicating confidence in the project?

# Price Forecast

Bitcoin has a 4 year halving cycle, with 2 years of bull market and 2 years of bear market. As with any asset class, it is not immune to speculative mania and leverage, which causes the its price to overextend before a steep correction.

[Money, Bitcoin and Time: Part 1 of 3](https://breedlove22.medium.com/money-bitcoin-and-time-part-1-of-3-b4f6bb036c04) explains Bitcoin in terms of "hard" and "soft" money.

Hard money is more trustworthy as a store of value precisely because it resists intentional debasements of its value by others and therefore maintains salability across time. The hardness of a monetary good, also known as its soundness, is determined by the stock-to-flow ratio:

* 'Stock' is the existing supply of monetary units
* 'Flow' is the newly created supply over a specified time period, usually one year
* Dividing the stock of a monetary good by its flow equals its stock-to-flow ratio
* The higher the stock-to-flow ratio, the greater the hardness (or soundness) of money
