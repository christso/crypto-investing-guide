This is a quick reference guide for crypto investors.

# The traditional financial system

Gold Standard prior to 1971

CBDCs are not cryptocurrencies.

# The decentralized financial system

# Why does Bitcoin exist?

# Common misconceptions about Bitcoin

## Bitcoin uses too much energy

[Bitcoin uses more electricity than Argentina - 9News](https://www.9news.com.au/technology/bitcoin-uses-more-electricity-than-argentina-norway-study-finds/eb51703b-db82-4fd3-ab2a-c79b96523455)

What the FUD articles assume is that there is value in securing a monetary network, and therefore any electricity used for the purpose is wasteful. It also ignores that the majority of Bitcoin mining is being powered by renewal energy or excess energy, and is moving towards that direction.

Setee is a company controlled by Norway's 2nd richest man, Kjell Inge Røkke. This is an excerpt from their [shareholder letter](https://www.seetee.io/static/shareholder_letter-6ae7e85717c28831bf1c0eca1d632722.pdf):

> Sec­ond, See­tee will es­tab­lish min­ing op­er­a­tions that trans­fer strand­ed or in­ter­mit­tent elec­tric­i­ty with­out sta­ble de­mand lo­cal­ly—wind, so­lar, hy­dro pow­er— to eco­nom­ic as­sets that can be used any­where. Bit­coin is, in our eyes, a load-bal­anc­ing eco­nom­ic bat­tery, and bat­ter­ies are es­sen­tial to the en­er­gy tran­si­tion re­quired to reach the tar­gets of the Paris Agreement. Our am­bi­tion is to be a valu­able part­ner in new re­new­able projects.



## The other coins are more affordable

## Bitcoin could dissappear like MySpace

"Blockchain not Bitcoin".

## Bitcoin will be banned

# Seed Storage Solutions

[Seedplate](https://store.coinkite.com/store/seedplate)

You can create a "multishard seed", where your seed is split into 3 shards, such that any 2 parts can reconstruct your complete seed. Each shard allows you to store up to 16 words of your seed phrase, and each unit tells you which 16 out of the 24 total words to load up. Shard One houses words 1 to 16, Shard Two houses words 9 to 24 and Shard 3 houses words 1 to 8 and 17 to 24. Once this process is complete, you will have effectively backed up each seed word twice.

# Altcoin Trading

## Portfolio Allocation

This is my portfolio allocation. I hold the majority in Bitcoin. I would only buy other coins if they are likely to outperform Bitcoin.

* Bitcoin (BTC) = 70% to 100%
* Ethereum (ETH) <= 30%
* Enjin (ENJ) <= 10%
* 0x (ZRX) <= 5%
* Secret (SCRT) <= 5%
* Storj (STORJ) <= 5%
* POWR <= 2%
* LINK <= 2%
* DOT <= 2%
* MANA <= 1%
* Band Protocol (BAND)
* Bancor (BNT)
* yearn.finance (YFI)
* Ren (REN)
* Hegic (HEGIC)
* Uniswap (UNI)
* Polkadot (DOT)
* Binance Coin (BNB) - fuel for Binance Smart Chain (BSC)

I occassionally trade a small amount of "questionable" coins, which Bitcoin maxis commonly refer to as "shitcoins". I do not recommend holding these coins for longer than a month or holding any amount that you cannot afford to lose completely. The price is driven mostly by speculation rather than any working decentralized product.

* Dogecoin (DOGE)
* Litecoin (LTC)
* Cardano (ADA)
* Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR)
* Nano (NANO)
* Ripple (XRP)

# Project Evaluation

Is product already working?

How strong is the ecosystem (developers, businesses, and users)?

What differentiates it from its competitors?

Does the monetary policy reward long-term holders?

Is the governance decentralised and resistant to attacks?

Are on-chain metrics indicating confidence in the project?
